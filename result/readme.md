# Avaliable results 
Here we provide the simulation saved results and real-data-analysis saved results in `.RData` form. These results are carried out via following the description in manuscript and Python, R code are all avaliable and discussed in the main.

## 2000
Most simulation setting is the case when $n = 2000$ and hence we provide results accordingly. Since the saved results are too large even after compression, we provide the following Dropbox link for download: [2000](https://www.dropbox.com/s/kfuoxl6dv60gs96/2000.zip?dl=0).

## real
